 *    TODO enforce limits on D,M,Y,H,M,S)
 *  - a PKCS#7 message
 *  - the data over which the signature is made.
 *
 * The result shall be either an error code describing the way in which the data
 * is unsuitable, or a set of data structures ready for signature verification.
 *
 * Successful return of the function implies that the authentication_2 structure
 * is valid but does not say anything about the PKCS#7 message.
 *
 * NB: it is possible for *data to point just past the end of buf and have
 * data_size = 0!
 *
 * Lifetime: outputs are just pointers into the input buffer, so they have the
 * same lifetime as the underlying buffer.
